Encouragement of Reporting<br/><br />
Northeastern University faculty and staff members are encouraged to report in good faith all information regarding alleged improper or wrongful activity that may constitute:<br/>

• Discrimination or harassment;<br />
• Fraud;<br />
• Unethical or unprofessional business conduct;<br />
• Academic, scientific or research misconduct;<br />

        <div class="panel-body">As members of the Northeastern community, staff, faculty, and students are expected to interact with each other with respect and consideration. When a community member’s conduct varies from this expectation, it is the responsibility of the manager, director, department chair, or dean who supervises the person engaging in the inappropriate conduct to address it. Inappropriate conduct covers a broad range of behavior from rude, obnoxious, bullying behavior to threats of violence. The level of danger in the behavior determines the action that the supervisor should take.

<br />For guidance on identifying potential threatening or violent behavior and for the best ways to deal with these incidents, contact the Office of Human Resources. or review the Guidance on Civility and Violence PDF document.<br />

<br />Expected Behavior<br /><br />
Each member of the Northeastern community is expected to treat other community members with civility and respect, recognizing that disagreement and informed debate are valued in an academic community.<br />

<br />Unacceptable Behavior<br /><br />
Demeaning, intimidating, threatening, bullying, or violent behaviors that affect the ability to learn, work, or live in the University environment depart from the standard for civility and respect. These behaviors have no place in the academic community.</div>

<br />Employment or Evaluation of Relatives: <br />
This policy is intended to protect the integrity of Northeastern University’s academic and work environment and ensure that it remains free from real or apparent conflicts of interest when individuals in positions of unequal power at the university are family members.  View the Employment or Evaluation of Relatives policy.


<br />Consensual Romantic or Sexual Relationships Between Faculty, Staff and Students
<br />This policy helps ensure that Northeastern’s academic, research and all other University environments remain free from real or apparent conflicts when individuals in positions of unequal power at the University are involved in consensual romantic or sexual relationships. With this policy, Northeastern joins a growing number of peer institutions in prohibiting faculty and coaches from engaging in romantic, dating, or sexual relationships with Northwestern undergraduate students, regardless of whether there is a supervisory or evaluative relationship between them.
